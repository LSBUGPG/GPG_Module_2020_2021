**Traffic light cups**

Usually when I run these classes, I use red :red_cup:, yellow :yellow_cup:, and green :green_cup: cups so you can each let me know how you are getting on. However, since we're doing this remotely, you can signal me by setting a custom status in Discord to red, yellow, or green.

- red :red_circle: means you are stuck and need help
- yellow :yellow_circle: means you have a question, but can continue
- green :green_circle: means you are fine and free to help somebody who is stuck

I'll keep an eye out for anyone with a yellow :yellow_cup: or red :red_cup: status and prioritise red.

If you are on green :green_cup: and you see someone else on red :red_cup: waiting for help, jump in and help; the easiest way to solidify your learning is to explain it to someone else! If somebody helps you, or you help somebody else, remember to note down the problem and the solution in your learning journal.

If you are on yellow :yellow_cup: or red :red_cup: remember to write out your question or problem in your learning journal while you are waiting for help.
