**Learning Journal**

One of the pieces of coursework for this course is a learning journal. In your journal you should make a note each time you learn something new as you are working. For each entry, write the date and a brief description. You should add entries for each new problem you encounter and each new solution you find.

The format of this journal is up to you. But I recommend keeping all of your programming files an a cloud based system such as GitHub.
