# Programming unplugged

When you first start programming it is easy to get distracted. You have a new language to learn with a new grammar, syntax, and punctuation rules. You need to know all of these things to write valid programs. However, no matter how well you know all of these things, it won't help you write programs that do what you want them to.

This exercise will help us practice the fundamental skill of programming: creating a sequence of clear instructions. And we can practice this without worrying about programming language grammar, syntax, or punctuation.

> In each part of this exercise, I'll ask you to send something to the next student. To find out which student you are sending to, you'll need to reference the table which I will build from your user names.

## Part 1

In this part you'll create a line drawing for a fellow student.

Draw a simple picture. Make it a recognisable but try to use less than a dozen lines. You can draw your image on paper, or use a drawing program. You'll need to save or scan your image as a file that you can share. Send your file to the next student.

In summary:

- simple line drawing
- recognisable picture
- draw on paper or use a drawing program
- less than a dozen lines
- save or scan your image
- send your file to the next student

## Part 2

You should have an image file from another student.

Think about how you would draw this image line by line. In this part of the exercise you need to write out a list of instructions to draw the image you have received. Don't describe the image. For example, if you have been given a picture of a house, don't write "draw a house." Instead, write down instructions for drawing each line. You can say to "draw a square" or "draw a circle" but remember that you'll still need to specify the position, orientation, and size of those shapes. Try to be brief but as unambiguous as you can. When you have your list of instructions, save them as a document and send it to the next student.

In summary:

- don't describe the image
- describe each line
- you may describe simple shapes
- save your instructions as a document
- send your document

## Part 3

You should have a list of instructions from another student.

Follow the instructions as best you can. If your instructions are ambiguous, make a guess. But don't try to guess the shape you've been asked to draw. Just interpret each instruction separately as best you can. When you've followed all of the instructions, scan or save your image as a file you can share. Return your image to the student who sent you the instructions.

In summary:

- follow each instruction
- treat each instruction separately
- complete all instructions
- scan or save your image
- return your image file

## Part 4

You should now have an image drawn to your instructions.

How closely does it match the image you wanted drawn?

Can you identify which instructions might need modification?
