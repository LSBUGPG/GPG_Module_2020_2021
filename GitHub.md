# GitHub

This is a free service that hosts code and other documents for collaboration on open source software projects. With an account you:

- always have a backup of your work at every stage
- can share projects with staff and other students
- can integrate changes collaboratively
- annotate your changes without cluttering up your source code

Sign up for an account at this address: [http://github.com]

If you want to keep your account after university (I recommend that you do as it has become an industry standard) you should sign up with your personal email. Otherwise you can use your university email or a throw-away email account to sign up.
